NOTE: The project I was working on that would have made use of doc_parser has been put on the backburner.
Consequently, doc_parser has also been put on hold. I may finish it if I have freetime, but it's no longer needed.
It's not much but it might be a halfway decent starting point for anyone interested in parsing docx/OOXML.

doc_parser is a set of tools written in Ruby designed to parse the docx file format to either rtf or html. 
After scouring around the internet for quite sometime, I couldn't find anything to fit my needs, 
so I decided to give it a try myself.

Required Gems:
rubyzip
libxml-ruby

Recent Changes:
added basic unzipping
added basic raw text parsing
