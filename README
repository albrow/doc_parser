doc_parser is a set of tools written in Ruby designed to parse the docx file format to either rtf or html. After scouring around the internet for quite sometime, I couldn't find anything to fit my needs, so I decided to give it a try myself.

Required Gems:
rubyzip
libxml-ruby

Recent Changes:
added basic unzipping
added basic raw text parsing
